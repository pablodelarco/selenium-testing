# Selenium Testing

This repository contains a simple Selenium script for interacting with the Selenium Easy Demo webpage. The script performs the following actions:

- Navigates to the Selenium Easy Demo page.
- Closes an annoying popup if present.
- Enters a user message, clicks the "Show Message" button, and verifies the displayed output.

## Instructions:

1. Ensure you have Python and Chrome installed.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install selenium`.
3. Download the [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and add its location to your system's PATH.
4. Run the script: `python script_name.py`.

Feel free to customize the script for your specific needs or contribute to its improvement.
